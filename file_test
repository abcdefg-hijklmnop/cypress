# testing webhook

didnt work with a webhook to master branch, while commit was in develop branch.

After changing default branch in github to master, since webhook checks master branch. still this file is in develop branch.

saw there were 3 delivery attempts of the webhook, that were timed out. so maybe it is something else.
trying woth the jenkins remote trigger Token - copied to the webhook Secret field.

# for webhook testing, i change a file in the master branch.

not yet triggered.
will try to add a selected option in the jenkins project configuration, to polls also.
